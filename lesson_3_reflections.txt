When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my project with other people. All as a backup place where I know
my stuff is safe my HDD gets corrupted.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I prefer manually pull because I can have some commits that are not prepared to be
consumed by other people. So although I want to have some historic of my development process
I may not want other people to have access to it before I have the rest of the work
done.
